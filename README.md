### Hi, I am Ammar Javed

I possess a unique combination of skills and expertise in web, desktop, and mobile apps. I am a strategic thinker and have problem-solving abilities. I can work independently and in a team. I am dedicated to continuous learning and professional development. I can develop high-quality apps, maintain the code to ensure it is up to date standards, and run tests to ensure that the app functions in all expected scenarios.
